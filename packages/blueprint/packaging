# Remove python2 backport module 'futures'
# In python 3, the functionalities of 'futures' are builtin. As the python-swiftclient package is compatiable for both
#   python2 and python3, it lists 'futures' in its dependencies list. We have to delete it to prevent python from using
#   the functionalities of this module which are incompatible with python3 itself.
# Unfortunately, pip has no mechanism to uninstall a package from a specific directory. Thus, we have to delete it manually.
